# My First Mobile App 

## Description
I'm following the "Learn JavaScript" course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home) and this is the fourth part of it.
In the previous part I built a Chrome extension and in this part I will learn how to connect it to a realtime database using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 

## Features
This Chrome Extension allows users to save URL's by passing them into an input field or by directly saving the tab that they are looking at.
The URL's are then displayed inside of the extension and they are saved inside the local storage of the browser.

## Remarks
...

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enjoy looking at what I have been learning and practicing with!
